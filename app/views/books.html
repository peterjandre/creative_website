    <h3>How I Spent One Year Drinking, Shaving, Farming, and Fathering My Way Toward Masculinity</h3>
    <p>
      In 2014, I spent 52 weeks filling in all the gaps of manly knowledge that I had never learned, spending each week on a different manly challenge. I had hoped that after a year of living like a capital-M man, I would finally feel like a truly realized adult. But what I discovered was that being a man in today’s age is a lot more complicated than just drinking scotch and smoking a pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      I compiled my favorite challenges into a book, currently available in print and e-book versions. The rest of the my very masculine year, including video footage of me living the manly life, can be found on the website, including short previews of the challenges that made it in the book.

              After realizing that my picky eating habits were better left to my childhood, I went on a quest to expand my personal tasting menu. I planned a three-course meal of raw eggs, spicy peppers, and bull genitalia to stretch my palate to new extremes.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a camera trained on me for all three meals, there was no possibility of welching on the deal I had made with myself. Still, that didn’t stop me from whining and tearing up at every opportunity. Hey, I never said this was going to be easy.

              Though tall heights never scared me, the idea of falling from those heights wasn't a thrill I was rushing to experience. Where bungee jumping, skydiving, and parasailing failed to entice me, however, the chance to play stuntman for a day entirely piqued my interest.
            </p>
            <p>
              By way of an attractively priced Groupon, I learned to fall properly and jump off of scaffolding three stories high with professional stuntmen. My falls were rehearsed, but the fear was real &mdash; no acting required.

              When a fitness test came back with pitiful results, I immediately signed up for a strenuous 5K obstacle course taking place in upstate New York. With the help of an experienced long distance runner and a particular pseudonym meant to bring out my most aggressive qualities, I took on the hardest race I’ve ever run.
            </p>
            <p>
              I knew they would be difficult, but I didn’t realize the mud, climbing walls, tunnels, and rope entanglements would prove so challenging. But I did sign up for an <i>obstacle</i> course, so that misjudgment was really on me.

              As someone who won’t step into a shower until the bathroom mirror is completely fogged up, the idea that people would willingly jump into a nearly frozen lake for <i>fun</i> does not compute. But it certainly qualified as a manly activity so I had no choice but to sign up for a polar bear plunge.
            </p>
            <p>
              With my concerned family waiting in the wings, I jumped in line at an annual plunge in my Virginia hometown. Again, I made sure there was video footage so I couldn’t wimp out at the last second.

              A clogged shower drain led to the revelation that I don’t have to call my super for every apartment emergency, but I could be capable of taking matters into my own hands. I signed up for a plumbing crash course at a technical school in Brooklyn, before taking my newfound skills back home to put them to the test.
            </p>
            <p>
              Taking on the shower drain and a leaky bathroom faucet with the help of methods both technical and homespun, I found that not having to rely on your super for help can feel pretty, well, super.
